You try your hardest to come up with an insult for Mulligan. He deserves it.
-My wife’s a hobby horse!
-What in the blazes did I just say?!
Your weariness only seems to make Mulligan laugh harder.
You can barely keep up with his ramblings. 
— Tell me, Mulligan, you said quietly, still embarrassed from your insult.
— Yes, my love?
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
Mulligan, not answering your question, proceeds to ramble on about how awful Haines is and something about you and something Kinch the knife-blade.
