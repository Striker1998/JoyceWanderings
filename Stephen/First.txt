You wake up blurry eyed and barely awake to the shouts of that accursed Buck Mulligan yelling for you, Kinch, to get up.
-Why is he so loud? You ask yourself.
Dragging yourself up the stairs of your tower, you see that gurgling fool.
You barely hear the nonsense he's spewing at you while you are just coldly look at him.
-What is he saying now? Calling your name absurd?
