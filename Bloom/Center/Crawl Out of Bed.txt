You are tired and exhausted and just flop out of bed and stumble to the door. Tripping on the edge of the bed, you collapse to the floor with a large thud. -Poldy! Are you okay? Molly asks. -grrroowoonnn I'm okaay. You say. Molly lays back down, excited for her breakfast. You start to go downstairs, but you trip and fall down the stairs.
Falling faster, must be the gravity. What is it? 32 feet per second... per second per...THUD!! Hopefully Molly did not notice. Don't want to have her getting out of bed before tea was ready. You get the kettle ready for the tea as well as get the coals ready.
Bread. Molly would like some bread... and butter. How many slices was it again?
