Walking into the bedroom, you try to sneak quietly to the wardrobe. Molly makes a soft groan as she rolls over next to you. You stand at the creaky wardrobe, ready to open when she rolls over again. You hear the jingling of the brass quoits of the bedside and you quickly open the wardrobe. Luckily, the jingling completely masks the creak of the wardrobe. You grab the key from your trousers and as you leave the room, you give Molly a quick, longing look. Rushing towards the door, you grab your overcoat and hat. Making sure you put your key with your potato, you exit 7 Eccles Street and lock the door behind you.
